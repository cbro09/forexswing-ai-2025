## üß† **What Are "Thinking" Trading Bots?**

### **Definition**
Thinking bots are AI trading systems that don't just execute pre-programmed strategies, but actively reason about market conditions, adapt their decision-making processes, and continuously learn from their environment. They exhibit characteristics of artificial general intelligence (AGI) applied to financial markets.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Adaptive Reasoning**: Change strategy based on market analysis
- **Meta-Learning**: Learn how to learn from new market patterns
- **Self-Reflection**: Analyze their own performance and adjust
- **Causal Understanding**: Understand why markets move, not just patterns
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Process text, numbers, news, sentiment simultaneously
